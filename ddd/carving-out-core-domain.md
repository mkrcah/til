## Focus on core domain by possibly carving out supportive and generic subdomains

In ExploreDDD keynote, [Eric Evans mentions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2IAgnpkBck) 
that we should focus on the core domain.
One possible way to achieve this is by chopping of supportive and generic subdomains, 
so that all that is left is the core domain.

Some observations
- to carve out the core, it might help to put things related to one supportive or generic subdomain together, instead of having it scattered around the codebase
